**PROFESSIONAL PROFILE**

Commercially focused Senior Full Stack Developer, Technical Architect
and Consultant with over 20 years' experience designing, building, and
delivering high-performance software systems across multiple platforms.
I specialise in creating scalable, maintainable, and efficient solutions
that solve real-world business problems --- from full-stack web
applications and SaaS platforms to desktop and mobile systems.

Operating as an independent contractor, I specialise in High-Performance
Systems, Artificial Intelligence (AI/LLM), and Cloud Architecture. Since
the early 2000s, I have managed teams of developers and engineers across
hundreds of projects, with ultimate responsibility for team leadership,
project delivery, and ensuring work is completed on time and within
budget.

I combine deep low-level engineering skills (C++, Go, Python) with
modern web expertise (Flask, Next.js, Quart, React, TypeScript). My
recent work focuses on building private AI inference infrastructure,
autonomous agents, and distributed data processing systems. I am seeking
contract opportunities in Backend Development, AI Engineering, or System
Architecture where I can leverage my ability to design scalable, secure,
and automated solutions.

**TECHNICAL ENGINEERING SHOWCASE PROJECTS --**
[*https://knws.co.uk/showcase*](https://knws.co.uk/showcase)

*A selection of advanced engineering projects demonstrating capabilities
in AI, High-Performance Computing, and Modern Web Architecture.*

**AI & Automation Engineering**

- AI-Powered Job Automation Platform: A comprehensive system using vLLM
  and Python to scrape, score, and auto-apply to contracts. Features
  AI-generated cover letters, geolocation routing (OSRM), and skill
  matching algorithms.

- vLLM Inference Infrastructure: Deployed a private, high-throughput LLM
  inference engine using vLLM, enabling real-time semantic analysis and
  privacy-focused AI processing within internal infrastructure.
  Innovated unlimited context in RAM feature to free up GPU memory.

- MCP Eyes (AI Agents): Developed a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server
  acting as a bridge between LLMs and OS automation. Enables AI agents
  to perform screen inspection (OpenCV) and control desktop environments
  on macOS/Linux.

- Global News Intelligence Engine: Built a massive-scale aggregation
  platform ingesting 50,000+ sources daily. Utilizes NLP for automatic
  categorization and deduplication, served via a Flask interface backed
  by MYSQL. Years of news stories archived and available in search.

**High-Performance & Systems Programming**

- Proxy Router (Go): Engineered a high-concurrency proxy aggregation
  router in Go (Golang). Manages thousands of simultaneous connections
  with automatic rotation, validation, and protocol translation
  (SOCKS5/HTTP), deployed via Docker.

- CoSearch (Big Data): Designed a search engine indexing 4+ million UK
  companies. Achieves sub-100ms query times using Async Python, MySQL 8
  FULLTEXT optimization, and custom relevance ranking algorithms.

- ATLAS Hybrid Video Codec (C++): Created a ground-up video codec
  combining classical signal processing with AI-assisted analysis.
  Features a modular C++ architecture with VLC and FFmpeg integration.
  It is a next generation .mp5 high compression codec.

**Modern Web & Frontend Architecture**

- GitHub Trending Analytics (Next.js): A real-time analytics dashboard
  built with Next.js, React, and TypeScript. Features a Quart (Async
  Python) backend for high-speed data ingestion and PostgreSQL for trend
  analysis. Linked directly to GitHub via API.

- Web Tools Suite (WebAssembly): A privacy-first utility suite running
  93+ tools entirely in the browser using WebAssembly (WASM) and FFmpeg,
  eliminating server-side processing for file conversions and analysis.

- Self-Hosted Infrastructure: Private implementations of Maps
  (OSRM/Leaflet), Speedtest (SVG/Glassmorphism), and Routing services,
  demonstrating full-stack capability independent of public APIs.

**PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE & KEY CONTRACTS**

2020-2025 Commercial Veterinary SaaS Platform *(12 month contract
extended to 60 months)*

> *Role: Senior Full Stack Developer & Technical Architect*
>
> *Tech:* *Python, Flask, AWS Cloud, REST API, JavaScript, OAuth2, SQL*
>
> Developed a commercial Python/Flask based SaaS application to audit
> billing data and prevent revenue misbilling in veterinary practices.
> If a vet entered an incorrect bill in the consulting room, by the time
> a client had made it to the reception desk to pay, my system would
> query the invoice, fix any issues and deliver it correctly prices
> automatically. If the customer wants interaction, it flags the vet as
> they try to complete the invoice what errors that have made and forces
> them to fix it and complete a correct bill. The system operated in two
> modes Audit Mode and Live Integration Mode. The Audit mode could
> identify misbilling whereas the Live mode would not only identify but
> could correct in real time. It connected to a popular online Practice
> Management System (PMS). Deployed on European AWS servers the project
> was in 27 languages.
