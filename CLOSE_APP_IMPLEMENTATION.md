# CloseApp Tool Implementation Summary

## Problem Solved

The original issue was that when users requested to "locate the window containing iTerm on the screen and close it using MCP-eyes", the assistant had to fall back to using AppleScript directly because there was no dedicated `closeApp` tool available. The `focusApplication` function was also having reliability issues in certain scenarios.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. New `closeApp` Tool

Added a comprehensive `closeApp` tool to multiple server variants:

- **Basic Server** (`src/basic-server.ts`)
- **Advanced Server** (`src/advanced-server.ts`)
- **Main Server** (`src/index.ts`)

### 2. Tool Features

The `closeApp` tool provides:

- **Multiple identification methods**: Bundle ID, app name, or PID
- **Graceful closure**: Attempts to quit applications normally first
- **Force closure**: Option to force-kill processes if graceful quit fails
- **Comprehensive error handling**: Clear error messages and fallback options
- **State management**: Automatically clears current app reference when closed

### 3. Tool Parameters

```typescript
{
  identifier: string,  // Bundle ID, app name, or PID
  force?: boolean      // Force close if graceful fails (default: false)
}
```

### 4. Implementation Details

The tool uses AppleScript to:
1. Find the target application by bundle ID, name, or PID
2. Attempt graceful quit using `targetApp.quit()`
3. Fall back to force kill using `kill -9` if graceful quit fails
4. Return detailed success/failure information

### 5. Usage Examples

```javascript
// Graceful close
await mcpClient.callTool('closeApp', { identifier: 'com.apple.Safari' });

// Force close if graceful fails
await mcpClient.callTool('closeApp', { identifier: 'iTerm2', force: true });

// Close by PID
await mcpClient.callTool('closeApp', { identifier: '12345' });
```

## Files Modified

1. **`src/basic-server.ts`** - Added closeApp tool definition and implementation
2. **`src/advanced-server.ts`** - Added closeApp tool definition and implementation
3. **`src/index.ts`** - Added closeApp tool definition and implementation
4. **`README.md`** - Updated documentation with closeApp examples and tool reference
5. **`test-close-app.js`** - Created test script for verification

## Benefits

1. **Resolves the original issue**: Users can now close applications directly through MCP-eyes without needing AppleScript fallbacks
2. **Improved reliability**: Multiple identification methods and fallback options
3. **Better user experience**: Clear success/failure messages and method reporting
4. **Consistent API**: Follows the same pattern as other MCP-eyes tools
5. **Comprehensive coverage**: Available in both basic and advanced server variants

## Testing

The implementation has been:
- ✅ Compiled successfully with TypeScript
- ✅ Added to multiple server variants
- ✅ Documented with examples
- ✅ Includes error handling and type safety

## Next Steps

The `closeApp` tool is now ready for use and should resolve the original issue where users had to rely on AppleScript for application closure. The tool provides a more reliable and user-friendly way to close applications through MCP-eyes.
